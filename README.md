# Human Activity Classification using Shimmer Wearable Sensors
This project focuses on classifying human activities using data collected from Shimmer wearable sensors. The sensor data is preprocessed and used to train an XGBoost model for accurate activity recognition such as walking, sitting, and running.
Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Model Used: XGBoost
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Workflow:
Data Acquisition: Collected accelerometer and gyroscope signals using Shimmer wearable sensors.
Preprocessing: Filtered noise, handled missing values, and normalized data for consistency.
Model Training: Used XGBoost to classify different human activities.
Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy, precision, and recall; visualized results with Matplotlib.
Prediction: Model accurately identifies activities such as walking, sitting, and running.
